## SETUP

1. Create Git Hub Repo
    README, .gitignore -> template = python

2. Create Virtual environment with specific python version

3. Create requirements.txt to write down all the dependancies for entire project
    '-e .' should be written as the last line of this file
    -e Install a project in editable mode (i.e. >setuptools “develop mode”) from a >local project path or a VCS url.
    dot indicates the path, i.e the actual directory i.e after executing requirements.txt go to setuptools and create the package 

4. Create setup.py to create the package of project
    Result of 3 and 4 will be the foldername.egg info i.e. package created and its detail

Note : In the project we will install dependancies quite often as we need them so its better to comment '-e .'
       bcoz every time we execute 'e .', it will again create package, it's like version 2, 3, 4 and so on
       while we are still creating our 1st version

5. Create src (source) folder and add __init__.py file in this folder and leave it blank for now


## Creating Source folder

1. Three important files
    -> exception.py : for exception handling, in this huge project which script is throwing error, what line no. and what is the error

    -> logger.py : maintain logs, when what happened (here specifically for status monitoring or fault investigation or exception handling,
                   as we are using severity level = logging.INFO)
    Note : Logs(i.e. logs or error which we got during the project) are ignored by .gitignore and it makes sense

    -> utils.py :
